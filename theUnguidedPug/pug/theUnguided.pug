            h3 press release 2017
            p Sadly former guitarist and singer Roland Johannsson has decided to leave The Unguided, but with new frontman; Jonathan Thorpenberg, THE UNGUIDED have found the perfect replacement! After having released a very well received 2-track EP in December of last year, it’s time to get ready for the full-length studio album! Please welcome “And The Battle Royale”.
            p Richard Sjunnesson states:
            p “We’ve without doubt sacrificed our five souls into this one. Everyone knew it would be a career defining record after the departure of our highly-acclaimed brother and we had no intensions to disappoint our fans nor ourselves writing and recording this dynamic monster with innovative producer Dino medanhodzic. Everyone indeed brought their absolute A-game on this record and Jonathan over performed in every possible way whilst also bringing something completely new to the table. A table which much urgently needed it I’d say.
            p This is a new chapter! This is THE UNGUIDED 2017!
            p THE UNGUIDED incubate a heavyweight of Melodic Death Metal which will freak out all metalcore forerunners in their greatest era.
            p But it doesn’t end there! There is more good news, as THE UNGUIDED have decided to deliver a full Live DVD with the limited Digipak version on top of this new release! The DVD captures Roland Johansson’s farewell show in Falkenberg (Sweden) with a unique 6-man strong setting of the band. This will be a killer package for sure!
            p In terms of excellent songwriting, both vocalists, Richard Sjunnesson and new addition Jonathan Thorpenberg, are building up a perfect symbiosis of brutal shouts and huge melodies! Stomping Industrial is gilded in heavy-handed synthesizers as a battle trophy. “And The Battle Royale” is a must-have for all those who value pure harshness with a good portion of sex appeal!

            strong How I joined the band:
            p I was asked to fill in for Roland at a gig in northern Sweden in the summer of 2015. I thought it would only be a one-time gig but I´m glad to say I was wrong. Because of Roland’s busy schedule outside the band, I was given the job of filling in for him on some more shows in Sweden and then on our spring tour in 2016. Later that year I was given the chance to be a permanent member of the band and let´s just say it was an offer I could not refuse. I am really looking forward to what the future has in store!

            strong How I joined the band:
            p After I left “Sonic Syndicate” in 2010 it was finally time for “The Unguided” to spread its crude wings of power! The concept of “The Unguided” was an old vision between me and Roger, originating back as far as 2008. But it was not until the end of 2010 it became definitive, when I and my brother together with Roland materialized the vague idea into solid reality.

And as the project became more and more a band, I was stoked to join as a official member in the autumn of 2011.

            p When I started playing for real (at the age of 15) At the Gates, Dissection, Edge of Sanity and In Flames was my main inspiration to play melodic death metal. Not really the members in the band, more the music it self. I will probably still get inspiration from those songs when I am 70.
